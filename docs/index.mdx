# TanStack Query Firebase

TanStack Query Firebase provides a set of easy to use hooks for common Firebase usecases. Each hook wraps around React Query, allowing to easily integrate the hooks into a new or existing project, whilst enjoying the powerful benefits React Query offers.

The exported hooks do not manage Query Keys or Firebase instances, giving you full control over integration.

## Installation

If you haven't done so already, install `react`, `@tanstack/react-query` & `firebase` (v9):

```bash
npm i --save react @tanstack/react-query firebase
```

> **Note**: The library only supports Firebase JS SDK v9 - [learn more about it here](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2021/08/the-new-firebase-js-sdk-now-ga.html)!

Before using this library, ensure [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is setup on your project by following the [Installation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/installation) guide.

Next install one of the TanStack Query Firebase package, e.g:

```bash
npm i --save @tanstack-query-firebase/react
```

## Core Concepts

Each package behaves with the same core concepts which are important to understand:

- Query based hooks are fetched according to your [TanStack Query Defaults](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/important-defaults) or per-hook configuration (as expected!).
- Query based hooks will refetch on [Query Key](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/query-keys) changes, not on Firebase argument changes. For example, if you change a Firestore Query argument you should also update the Query Key to ensure the hook is re-fetched.
